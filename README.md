# Seattle Now - CS50 Final Project

This is my final project for Harvard's CS50 course.  
Itâ€™s a Flask website that shows local Seattle weather, events, and news using free APIs.  

- Weather data from OpenWeatherMap  
- Events from Ticketmaster Discovery API  
- News from NewsAPI.org  

Visit the project site: (Coming soon)
